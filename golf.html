        <h3>How I got started</h3>
        <p>
        My interest in golf started with a middle school golf club. When I told my parents I wanted to join, they quickly mobilized my Nana, a profession yard-saler (she could spot an antique-dealer a mile away and could haggle with the best of them). She was able to quickly put together a set of clubs for me to get started. While I appreciated them, I did get picked on because my woods were actually made of wood. That already made my start somewhat rough, and then I discovered I was the only one that had never played. I learned what I could from the club, but that wasn’t much. I later found out that the club was formed to gauge interest for a school golf team. I assume they realized they didn’t need to spend much time teaching since they had several skilled players.
        </p>
        <p>
        My Nana and Grampa took me out every so often and helped me to develop some skills. I thoroughly enjoyed these trips, and these are some of my fondest memories with my grandparents. They often brought their friends along as well. Although I only had a few opportunities to learn from him, their friend Bob Mahoney taught me several skills that I never forgot. He was patient with an extreme kindness in his demeanor. The one I remember the most was he used shoveling snow as a comparison for how to move your body when swinging a club.

        <h3>The Break</h3>
        <p>
        By the time I got into high school, I rarely played because of the cost. Also, around this time, my uncle gifted me his old set of clubs. The set included metal driver and 3 wood, as well as a full set of Tommy Armour 845 irons. The new set of clubs inspired me to get out a few more times, but ultimately I couldn’t afford to be a regular golfer. I hung on to those clubs for many years without touching them. I finally decided I was probably done with golf and donated my clubs.

        <h3>The Comeback</h3>
        <p>
        It's all Nintendo’s fault! Christmas of 2021 brought the usual holiday cheer and celebration as well as Mario Golf for the Switch. We purchased the game for my sons, but it quickly became a family favorite. The four of us spent hours competing. Then came the fateful day when my oldest came to us and said he wanted to play golf. We got him started with lessons, and within a short amount of time I started to get the itch. I ended up getting a set of Top-Flites from Dick’s and I’ve been obsessed with getting better ever since. My game still needs a great deal of improvement, but I get to enjoy playing with my boys (the younger one took an interest as well) as well as a great group of golf buddies.
