		<h2 class="bp">How I got started</h2>
		<p class="bp">
		I first took an interest in bourbon in 2015 when I accompanied my wife to a convention in Louisville, Ky. I found myself with an entire day where she would be occupied, thus leaving me to go exploring. I walked several blocks over to the Evans Williams Distillery to take their tour. The tour was well put together, interactive, and ended with a tasting. The tasting began with Evan Williams Black Label and a couple others that weren’t very memorable. The last sample was Larceny. It was flavorful, sweet, and smooth. The first whiskey I could see myself sipping neat. That taste started me down the path of trying to taste as many different bourbons as possible. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="bp">What is Bourbon?</h2>
		<p class="bp">
		For those that don’t know, Bourbon is America’s native spirit, much like Scotch is native to Scotland. According to 27 C.F.R. 5.22, Bourbon must be distilled in the United States, have a mash bill of at least 51% corn, and be aged in a charred new oak barrel. Furthermore, it must enter the barrel at no more than 125 proof, cannot exceed 160 proof, and must be bottled at no less than 80 proof. With these requirements met, you end up with a deliciously sweet and distinctly American whiskey. Bourbon is so much more than the liquid result of a bunch of legal requirements though. It is steeped in rich history. The cast of characters range from statesman to criminals. Some are real, some exaggerated, and others completely made up. Real or not, the stories that accompany bottle add to the enjoyment of drinking it just as much as the nose, palette, and finish. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="bp">Current Collection</h2>
		<p class="bp">
		Since that fateful tasting back in 2015, I’ve acquired multiple different bottles of varying price ranges. My collection was entirely found in the wild. I refuse to pay the price demanded on the secondary market. To me, the secondary market is the easy way to a goal (if you have the money). It is the drive to the top of the mountain rather than the hike. I find just as much joy in the hunt as I do in the consumption. There is nothing like the adventure of going to new ABC wondering what gem you might find there. You may be surprised to find out that a high price tag does not always mean the best whiskey and some of the lower prices can’t be beat. Below is my current collection.
