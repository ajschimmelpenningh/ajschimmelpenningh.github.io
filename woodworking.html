			<h2>How It Began</h2>
			<p>
				Two of my shorter-lived careers were installing hardwood floors and framing houses. At that time, woodworking did not stimulate my interests. Several years later (2014), my wife and I decided it was time for the downstairs carpeting to be replaced with snap together laminate flooring. The only way to afford this was for me to do the installation. I purchased a cheap table saw with the intent of selling it as soon as I completed my project. Procrastination struck and I ended up keeping it for a while. The following year we decided to sell the house. My wife then decided I had to hold on to the saw long enough to build her a bench in our new home.

			  The bench was a bit crude and constructed out of deconstructed pallets, but I felt pretty good about myself having built it. As the interest grew so did my collection of tools and my abilities. I’ve since tackled multiple projects from home décor to furniture. With every project the sense of pride remains. The original bench no longer serves its original purpose in our mudroom, but we kept it in a spare bedroom because we couldn’t bear to get rid of it.

		  <h2>Pallet Flags</h2>

			<p>
			I came up with an efficient system for making these pallet flags. For a while, I was able to sell these often because they could be thrown together so quickly. I ordered a stencil for the stars. Then I cut thirteen strips of pallet wood to equal length and width. Then I could spray all the white stripes and red stripes at once. I used a few strips of masking tape to keep the upper corner clear. After a short wait for drying, I’d move the tape over and paint the blue section. Next, I assembled them with wood strips on the back using a finish nailer and glue. For the finish, I attached my star stencil to a piece of cardboard so I could lay it down quickly and spray the stars on. It always brings a smile to my face when I’m out walking and see one of these on a neighbor’s porch.

		  <h2>Serving Tray</h2>

			These trays were another quick project. I simply attached at the ends with the raised edges. After applying the finish of choice, I added a couple decorative handles. These can be functional serving trays or a simple accent piece.

			<p>
			These are the nightstands I made for my sons. The one on the left was made to have a distressed look. We ended up staining it a dark brown. With the one on the right I spent more time squaring everything up to give a sleeker modern look. These were both fairly simple to build once I came up with the concepts and they’ve held up for several years now.

		  <h2>Dining Table</h2>

			<p>
			My dining table was one of the biggest projects I have ever taken on. I started this project at  point when life was starting to get much busier than it had been. If I remember correctly, it took several months to complete. I purchased the wood for from The Barn Side of a Broad in Garner, NC. All the wood came from barns that she had torn down in the area. The legs are made out of pine 4x4’s and 2x4’s. The top is made from wide poplar planks. I had to trim some of them down to shorter widths due to some cupping that took place. This one brings me the most joy of all my projects because I get to enjoy it surrounded by the ones I love.

		  <h2>Coffee Bar</h2>

			<p>
			For Christmas 2021, the only gift my wife wanted was a long narrow table to use as a coffee bar. I used some scrap 2x6’s for the legs. The shelf is poplar 1x4’s and 1x8. The top is acacia wood butcher block. I ordered this from Home Depot and trimmed it to size. I coated the butcher block with Rubio-Monocoat. This stuff is great! It is a hard wax finish that maintains the natural look and feel of the wood grain, while providing excellent protection.

			<p>
			This is my current project. It has taken more time than I care to tell. The progress has been slow, but I’m very pleased with how it has come out so far. This is why the original bench had to move upstairs. We decided to do a full built in for our mudroom. The best part about this build, is that it gave me an excuse to buy a track saw. I wish I had bought it so much sooner than I did. Please check back in the future to see if I’ve made any more progress.
