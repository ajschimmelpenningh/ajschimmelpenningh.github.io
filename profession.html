        <h3>My Nuclear Security Journey</h3>
        <p>
        I moved to North Carolina in 2006. After a brief stint in the Parts Department of a Ford Dealership, I found myself in need of a new employer. I checked the newspaper and online job boards every day to see if there were any promising leads. After a few months I found an ad in the paper for Nuclear Security Officers. I circled the ad, but then talked myself out of applying since I was lacking any experience. A family member later convinced me to apply and see what happens. I was hired August of 2007. Next up, six weeks of training that included legal requirements, firearms, use of force, team tactics, defensive strategy, and much more. I continued to build upon my skills and knowledge on shift. I volunteered for extra responsibilities whenever I thought I could help the team with my skills. After several years, I made the jump to a leadership role. This was a major adjustment for me. Security work in general required me to step outside my comfort zone, but now I was stepping into a position that put me in charge of the people that taught me this trade, and who I thought, were better suited to lead. As I worked up to my current role of Response Team Leader, Iâ€™ve learned that you earn the respect of almost anyone if you take the time to get to know them and treat them with respect. Leadership requires continuous growth and learning. Nuclear Security requires you to be constantly prepared for an event that will hopefully never happen. My job is to make sure my team is ready to respond if that time ever comes.
