        <h2>About Me and My Family</h2>
        <p>
        I grew up in Douglas, MA, a small town right where Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island all meet. Growing up here, is where I gained my love of rural America. I spent most of my days out in the woods seeking some sort of adventure, but usually found a way to get in trouble. I moved to Chico, CA the day after my twenty-first birthday. While living in California, I had the opportunity to see amazing places like Lassen Volcanic Park, Lake Tahoe, and Yosemite National Park. Chico was a fun town, and I loved the adventures that could be had on weekend road trips, but California just never felt like home. I didn’t have much choice in the next place life took me because I had spent all my money and had to move back in with my parents. This happened right when they decided to move to North Carolina. I came here with the goal of getting back on my feet and moving somewhere more exciting as soon as possible. Then I learned the most valuable lesson in my life. Sometimes you need to realize that your plans don’t matter, and you need to recognize when to cast them aside. This lesson led me to the woman of my dreams who continues to fulfill my life in places that I didn’t realize were empty. We married in 2010, had our first son in 2012, and our second in 2013. I couldn’t imagine going through the rest of my days without them.
